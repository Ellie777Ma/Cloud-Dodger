### Project Summary
This program is called "Cloud Dodger". It's a runner type game, where the player controls a square flying through a
large city at night. You must avoid colliding with any of the oncoming clouds, otherwise the game will go on and close
the game's window. You control the square with your mouse, as the square will remain at the same height as your mouse.
The buildings will change color as the flying square hovers over them. You can exit the game by pressing the esc key
on your keyboard.

### Language and Installations

### Bugs
