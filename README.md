# CS 2300 - M4OEP
## Elizabeth Ma, Spring 2025
This program utilizes no installations outside any that may've been included within the Runner guided project.
This project utilizes the following concepts:
- OpenGL / GLFW
- Drawing
- Mouse input (mouse movement)
- Non-input-based events

This program is called "Cloud Dodger". It's a runner type game, where the player controls a square flying through a
large city at night. You must avoid colliding with any of the oncoming clouds, otherwise the game will go on and exit
out of the window.

At the current moment, there aren't any known bugs at the time of submission.

If I had more time, I'd try to figure out a way to implement a start screen with instructions on the game, a
timer/score system that tracks how long you survive and/or awards points based on how long you last without colliding
into a cloud, and a game over screen for when you collide with a cloud, instructing you to press esc to exit the window.

All code within this project has been written by either me or is code from my instructor, specifically the code from
the Runner project from my instructor.

As far as I can tell, I believe I'll receive around 70 points for this project.
My project utilizes some concepts from module 4, is interactive, functions as intended and has about the same level of
complexity as a guided project does (20pts). It's fully interactive without any issues (20pts), user-friendly (20pts),
and organized well (20pts). In addition, the code is well organized with comments explaining the functionality of each
code segment and the video includes multiple demo runs. The main issue was that I have been so busy I forgot to create
the M4OEP repository earlier and make repository commits over the span of a week (-10pts ;^;). While I hope you'll
understand and have mercy, I understand if the lack of spaced out commits will hurt the amount of points I can get.
