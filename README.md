# CS 2300 - M4OEP

This program utilizes no installations outside any that may've been included within
in the Runner guided project. This project utilizes the following concepts:
- OpenGL / GLFW
- Drawing
- Mouse input (mouse movement)
- Non-input-based events

This program is a runner type game, where the player controls a square flying through
a city at night. You must avoid colliding with any of the oncoming clouds, otherwise the
game will go on and exit out of the window.

At the current moment, there aren't any known bugs at the time of submission.

If I had more time, I'd try to figure out a way to implement a tart screen, a
timer/score system that tracks how long you survive and/or awards points based on how
long you last without colliding into a cloud, and a game over screen for when you
collide with a cloud.

All code within this project has been written by either me or is code from my instructor.
specifically the Runner guided project from my instructor.

As far as I can tell
